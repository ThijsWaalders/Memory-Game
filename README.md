# Memory Game

## Instructions

Here is my memory game. I need to convert from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily JavaScript.

##Code Dependencies
I have followed [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/) tutorial to get the game working.
I've found many different tutorials, but this one has my attention because it is done in JavaScript only. This seemed to me the best way to learn JS and understand it.
After that I have searched for the functions I needed and choose mostly the shortest code, mostly from the Udacity's Slack channels and some code from the legendary [stackoverflow.com](https://www.stackoverflow.com)
And I have also used **jQuery 3.3.1 / Googlefonts / Awesomefonts** for the icons
